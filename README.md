## Overview
Modern life makes it easy to lose touch. Friendships and connections fade not because the spark dies, but because of poor time management and inconsistent communication. Friendly helps users maintain relationships intentionally by providing:

- Timely reminders  
- Suggested messages for awkward check-ins  
- Private, low-pressure memory sharing  

Friendly does not require both parties to be on the app. It connects to your existing contacts, nudging you to reach out via your preferred communication channels – such as WhatsApp, SMS, or email.

It is designed for individuals who want to nurture relationships without feeling guilty or overwhelmed.

## Problem Statement
People struggle to maintain relationships consistently. Texts go unanswered, "we should catch up" turns into months of silence, and meaningful connections fade unintentionally. Traditional social platforms focus on broadcasting, not maintaining genuine contact. Existing contact apps are often mechanical and fail to nudge users intelligently.  

Friendly bridges that gap – merging relationship management, lightweight social interaction, and intentional reminders, without requiring everyone to be on the same platform.

## Key Features

### 1. Cadres of Connection
Users can categorize contacts into defined tiers of closeness, ensuring notifications are meaningful and contextually appropriate:

- **Inner Circle** – People you talk to most often; daily/weekly contact (family, best friends, partner)
- **Close Friends** – Personal relationships but not everyday communication
- **Friends** – General social group with regular but less frequent interaction
- **Acquaintances** – Friendly contacts with low engagement expectations
- **Professional / Need-to-Have** – Networking or collaboration contacts (colleagues, clients, business partners)
- **Must Contact Occasionally** – People you want to keep in touch with every few months (mentors, role models, distant friends, former colleagues)

Each cadre defines how frequently the app nudges you to connect. For example, you won't get a notification to call a carpenter you worked with 2 years ago when you should be checking in with your best friend. The app intelligently prioritizes based on your defined relationships.

### 2. Contact Reminders
Custom or automatic nudges for check-ins, informed by cadre settings and interaction history.

### 3. Message Suggestions
Optional pre-written messages for smooth reconnecting, tailored to the relationship tier.

### 4. Moments
Private, low-pressure feed for sharing thoughts, images, or updates with selected cadres.

### 5. Smart Suggestions
Learn from patterns to recommend when and whom to contact, respecting cadre boundaries.

### 6. Privacy & Control
All data is private; opt-in notifications only. You control who belongs in which cadre.
